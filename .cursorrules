# Cursor Rules for EORI Platform

## Database Migrations

**IMPORTANT**: Database migrations are managed through SQL scripts that must be run manually by the user.

- Migrations are located in `database/migrations/`
- Migration files follow the pattern: `000X_description.sql`
- **DO NOT** use `drizzle-kit push` or `drizzle-kit migrate` to apply migrations automatically
- **DO** use `drizzle-kit generate` to generate migration files from schema changes
- **DO** run SQL migration scripts manually using your preferred PostgreSQL client (psql, pgAdmin, etc.)
- Always test migrations on a development database before applying to production

## Schema Changes Workflow

1. Modify schema files in `database/schema/`
2. Run `npm run db:generate` to generate migration SQL
3. Review the generated migration file
4. Run the migration SQL script manually against the database
5. Verify the changes were applied correctly

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Follow existing patterns for API routes, hooks, and components
- Use snake_case for database column names
- Use camelCase for TypeScript variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for component names
